CATEGORY="Devel"
SUMMARY="Multiple-precision floating point computation library for Win64 toolchain"
DESCRIPTION="The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-
precision floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a
well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754
standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit significand)."
